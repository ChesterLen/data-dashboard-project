    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-dashboard.git
    cd sales-data-dashboard
    
    2. Set Up the Environment
    
    Create and activate a virtual environment:
    
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate # For macOS/Linux
    env\Scripts\activate # For Windows
    
    Install the required dependencies:
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    3. Create or Load the Dataset
    
    Use the create_dataset.py script to generate the dataset:
    
    python src/create_dataset.py
    
    The dataset will be saved as data/sales_data.csv.
    
    4. Import the Dataset into SQL
    
    Run the import_to_sql.py script to import the dataset into a local SQLite database:
    
    python src/import_to_sql.py
    
    5. Run the Dashboard
    
    Start the dashboard application:
    
    python src/dashboard_app.py
    
    Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to view the dashboard.

üìà Key SQL Queries

    Here are some of the key SQL queries used in this project:
    
    Monthly Revenue:
    
    SELECT strftime('%Y-%m', TransactionDate) AS Month, SUM(Price * Quantity) AS Revenue
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY Month
    ORDER BY Month;
    
    Top-Selling Products:
    
    SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY Product
    ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    
    Customer Segmentation by Revenue:
    
    SELECT CustomerName, SUM(Price * Quantity) AS TotalSpent
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY CustomerName
    ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;
